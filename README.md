# Python-Algo-Trading
A Python bot that uses the RSI Index to choose when to buy and sell stocks.

This bot uses Alpaca to paper trade stocks. The program web scrapes live stock prices from Yahoo Finance to use and calculate the RSI Index for certain stocks. In addition, the program has a webserver with live data that shows what the bot is currently doing. All stocks are sold at the end of the day and a log is kept on all actions the bot performs for analysis.
